<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process
`Conceptual Process`
The Web App concept came from my fanlove for the UFC as well as my passion of being an MMA AM-fighter in training.
Sportdata io was the only database that supplies the one and only MMA API and I decided to choose and integrate this API.
Starting the project with a basic html and css file was mundane for me and I veered over to changing the project into a angularfire app.
The idea of a virtual dom and assets and data appearing and dissapearing (like react) was appealing, thus my research into angular started.
Numerous documentations were read and summed up and saved for reference.
Numerous hours spent learning angular and hsoting my web app onto Firebase, both equally new concept frameworks to me.
Numerous hours soent debugging proved the challenge was worth it.
The design of the UI, made with angular ui, is minimalistic, simple, and to the point.

### Wireframes

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Utilized and implemented `Angular` for a dynamic web app.
Integration of `Angular UI` for UI.
* 'Injection' of components integration and usage. 
* Integration of typescript and JS .
* Implemented KISS method and achieved easier css skills.
* Async await  used iso axios.get. 
* Implemented CloudFunctions with `firebase-functions` and `firebase-admin`.
* API calls failed, debugged cloudfunction api calls.
* API End Point with cloud functions for Fighters: https://us-central1-fight-site-6dbcd.cloudfunctions.net/getFighters
* API End Point for Fighters: https://api.sportsdata.io/v3/mma/scores/json/Fighters?(key)
* Firebase Hosting.
* Google Analytics SEO data.
* No PHP script used for feedback component. Debugged countless times. Integrated functional Angular form.
* Custom event Parameters and collections made to CAPTURE, VIEW, ANALYSE AND STORE User Feedback.
* Implemented snackbar after user feedback captured.
* Enabled and disabled Google Ads before budget expiry.
* Bought my own domain on domains.co.za
* Implemented Google Indexing into Web App.
* Implemented Sitemap into Web App.
* Reached countries, far and wide.
* Achieved a minimalistic designed web app, yet a powerful reminder to fans of the UFC.


#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* SOLVING A HUGE CORS ERROR!
*From throwing away the first web app, to  taking a step back.
* learning a new framework, to going over and beyond with the latest web app.
* implementing angular and firebase hosting.
* integrating a functional angular feedback form.
* Storing and analysing user feedback in my GA and FB.
* The successfull debugging were many times a highlite
* The freedom of time spent to make this web app and not feel pressured but calm, working chunk for chunk.
* Not giving up.
* Working in the NETWORKING console 70% of the time
* Being asked by my MMA gym to create a website for them.


#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* redoing the entirity of the project x3 times.
* Dealnig with constructive feedback and implementing a bigger goal for myself
* CORS.
* Bugs.
* Bugs.
* CORS
* infinite API calls
* Figuring out Firebase and Angular
* Figuring out FB analytics to capture and store and analyse user feedback
* Google Indexing as the crawlers takes time and the web app can benefit from being hosted longer

#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* Instead of a normal .html and .css web app, I took a different yet difficult and stresful route.
* ANGULAR
* Designed for single-page-apps, just like react. Includes typescript components and injection of components and a faster way to update and deploy a web app.
* BigQuery Integration serverless integration allowing data to be analysed and stored linking with GA and FB
* Angular UI
* 'Reusable' components as well as a faster way of developing the front ui of a web app.
* Firebase Hosting
* Creating a custom collection in firestore database to store user incmoing feedback
* Firstly, it is developed by Google, and it is free. It walks hand in hand with angular, hence angularfire, using cloudfunctions to send and get API calls. Because of using Google Analytics for SEO, after asking for permission to use Firebase, this was the route taken, and stuck with, for richer data wrt SEO analysis. I used my personal gmail account as I will be using Firebase in the future more often.
* Using and imlpementing Angular Pipes


### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* Bettings for UFC fighters
* Charts
* Adding to the API IMAGEs of all 1000+ fighters one day...
* Making my own UFC API
* Visual and dynamic comparitive dashboards for fighters
